<ul> 
  <li><b>Handwritten Digit Classification</b>
    <ul> 
      <li>Used MNIST data set which contains 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel gray scale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
      <li>Classified a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.
      <li> Used Computer Vision concepts, Neural network and Convolutional Neural Network Model to classify the digits.
    </ul> 
  <li><b>Image Classifier: Cat Vs Dog</b>
    <ul> 
      <li>The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats.
      <li>The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. 
      <li>For each image in the test set, you should predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).
      <li>Built an Image Classifier which can detect Cats and Dogs from test set of images.
      <li>Used Computer Vision concepts and Deep Neural Network Model to classify the image as Cat or Dog. 
    </ul>
